# Python-Programming
A course I did that takes a look into the fundamentals of Python 3 programming, covering the basic components and structures of the Python language.

## Contents:

- Introduction
- Fundementals of the Python language
- Conditional structure if-elif-else
- Iteration and Iterative structures
- External files in Python

## ex_1_1
Make a program which prints the following text:

```
Hello World!
This here is a Python program.
```

## ex_2_1
Create a variable by giving it the correct name, and assign it the string "string-type content" as a value. Then insert this variable into a print command so that the program prints out following text:

```
Our variable has a value which is string-type content. Isn't that nice?
```
## ex_2_2
 In this exercise, define two variables and assign them values of 1000 and 24. After this, make the interpreter do the calculation number1+number2+15 and then take the 2nd exponent (**2) of the result. Save this final result to a new variable, and make the program print the result in the following way:

```
The final results of the calculation was: 1079521
```

## ex_2_3
Start by defining two variables, and assign the first variable the float value 10.6411. The second variable gets a string "Stringline!" as a value. Convert the first variable to an integer, and multiply the variable with the string by 2. After this, finalize the program to print out the results in the following way:

```
Integer conversion cannot do roundings: 10
Multiplying strings also causes trouble: Stringline!Stringline!
```
