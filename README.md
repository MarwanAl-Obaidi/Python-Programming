# Python-Programming
A course I did that takes a look into the fundamentals of Python 3 programming, covering the basic components and structures of the Python language.

## ex_1_1
Make a program which prints the following text:

```
Hello World!
This here is a Python program.
```

## ex_2_1
Create a variable by giving it the correct name, and assign it the string "string-type content" as a value. Then insert this variable into a print command so that the program prints out following text:

```
Our variable has a value which is string-type content. Isn't that nice?
```
